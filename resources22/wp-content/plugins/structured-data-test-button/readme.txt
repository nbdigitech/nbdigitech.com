== Introduction to Structured Data ==
 
Structured data markup describes things on the web, along with their properties. For example, if your site has recipes, you could use markup to describe properties for each recipe, such as the summary, the URL to a photo for the dish, and its overall rating from users.

When you provide structured data markup for your online content, you make that content eligible to appear in two categories of Google Search features:

* **Rich results** — Structured data for things like recipes, articles, and videos can appear in Rich Cards, as either a single element or a list of items. Other kinds of structured data can enhance the appearance of your site in Search, such as with [Breadcrumbs](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/breadcrumbs), or a [Sitelinks Search Box](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/sitelinks-searchbox).
* **Knowledge Graph cards** — If you're the authority for certain content, Google can treat the structured data on your site as factual and import it into the [Knowledge Graph](http://www.google.com/intl/es419/insidesearch/features/search/knowledge.html), where it can power prominent answers in Search and across Google properties. Knowledge Graph cards appear for authoritative data about [organizations](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/corporate-contacts), and [events](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/events). [Movie reviews](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/reviews), and [movie/music play actions](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/tv-movies), while based on ranking, can also appear in Knowledge Graph cards once they are reconciled to Knowledge Graph entities.
